This is a beginner level Capture the flag challenge, I think it's very nice for beginners. Here's the writeup.

## Task 1 Translation & Shifting

#### c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?

This is easy, just sit back and watch it, you'll find that sentence. for example, 4 looks just like A.

#### 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001

Binary, so search for some `binary to text` tool online, I got this: [Binary to Text Translator](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html). Paste all 0&1s and you'll see.

#### MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======

This looks like base 64 but somewhere is different, because there's no lowercase letters. Try search `base` in Kali bin, there's base32/base58/base64. Let's begin with base32.

```
echo MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM====== | base32 -d -
```

#### RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==

This looks like base64, try:

```
echo RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg== | base64 -d -
```

#### 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f

Hex value? try hex2raw.

```
$ hex2raw
68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f
```

#### Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!

This is difficult. I guess 13 is some key word. Google for `cipher identifier` leads me to [this website](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), so the cipher method is `ROT-13`, and the website provides a ROT-13 decoder.

** This website is nice **

#### *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX

Paste it in [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)，it's ROT-47.

#### - . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -. . -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.

Morse Code? Paste it in [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)，try Morse Code .

#### 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68

looks like ASCII. yep, it is.

What's this? I've found so many LS0xs with a `=` ending, maybe base64?

Come on, morse code again? 8 codes in each line, binary? Fine, I'll try [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

1. from base64
2. from morse code

Got a weird text: 
```
fe `_` ``e bh ``d ba `_h hf `_f `_` ba ``e `_c `_d ``d ba hf ba hg `_d ``e ba ``e ``c `_d hh `_f `_d `_` ``c ce ce ce
```

Try [dcode.fr](www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), it's ROT-47.

Now it looks like ASCII:

```
76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46
```


The full CyberChef steps are:

1. from base64
2. from morse code
3. from binary
4. rot47
5. from decimal

## Task 2 Spectrograms

This task costs me some time to crack. well, it actually doesn't encrypt. TL;DR, again I used [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/spectral-analysis). Upload, and SEE.

## Task 3 Steganography 

use `steghide`,  no passphrase.

## Task 4 Security through obscurity

This one is a bit difficult, I use steghide but no result is found in `meme.jpg`,  so try `binwalk`

```
$ binwalk meme.jpg

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```

There's some RAR data, let me see what's inside.

```
dd if=meme.jpg ibs=74407 skip=1 of=m2.rar
unrar x m2.rar
```

There it is.

The last question, **Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.**

I tried so many tools, well, check `hexeditor` and scroll to the end of the file.
